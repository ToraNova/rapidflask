The files in the reference directory are references from the past pyflask projects
these files are from the original petabus/zfence projects and are removed from the
server directory to allow for improvement. We do not want to continue building on
failure.

The methods here are highly deprecated and must not be repeated. They are only stored
here for backward references and should not be copied !
